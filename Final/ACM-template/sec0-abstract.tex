In this report, we discuss several indexing methodologies; such as Inverted indexing: In-memory, Merge-based inversion, hybrid approach for maintaining inverted indexes;
Next-word indexing including its construction and compaction techniques; Suffix Array and BWT for optimising large scale pattern search. Further, we perform a critical analysis of
these techniques.
